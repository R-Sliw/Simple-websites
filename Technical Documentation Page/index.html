            <p>
              CSS Grid Layout introduces a two-dimensional grid system to CSS.
              Grids can be used to lay out major page areas or small user
              interface elements. This article introduces the CSS Grid Layout
              and the new terminology that is part of the CSS Grid Layout Level
              1 specification. The features shown in this overview will then be
              explained in greater detail in the rest of this guide.
            </p>
            <h1>What is a grid?</h1>
            <p>
              A grid is a set of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines
              defining columns and rows. Elements can be placed onto the grid
              within these column and row lines. CSS grid layout has the
              following features:
            </p>
            <h3>Fixed and flexible track sizes</h3>
            <p>
              You can create a grid with fixed track sizes – using pixels for
              example. This sets the grid to the specified pixel which fits to
              the layout you desire. You can also create a grid using flexible
              sizes with percentages or with the new fr unit designed for this
              purpose.
            </p>
            <h3>Item placement</h3>
            <p>
              You can place items into a precise location on the grid using line
              numbers, names or by targeting an area of the grid. Grid also
              contains an algorithm to control the placement of items not given
              an explicit position on the grid.
            </p>
            <h3>Creation of additional tracks to hold content</h3>
            <p>
              You can define an explicit grid with grid layout. The Grid Layout
              specification is flexible enough to add additional rows and
              columns when needed. Features such as adding “as many columns that
              will fit into a container” are included.
            </p>
            <h3>Alignment control</h3>
            <p>
              Grid contains alignment features so we can control how the items
              align once placed into a grid area, and how the entire grid is
              aligned.
            </p>
            <h3>Control of overlapping content</h3>
            <p>
              More than one item can be placed into a grid cell or area and they
              can partially overlap each other. This layering may then be
              controlled with the z-index property.
            </p>
            <p>
              Grid is a powerful specification that, when combined with other
              parts of CSS such as flexbox, can help you create layouts that
              were previously impossible to build in CSS. It all starts by
              creating a grid in your grid container.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="The_Grid_container">
            <header><h1>The Grid container</h1></header>
            <p>
              We create a grid container by declaring
              <i>display: grid or display: inline-grid</i> on an element. As
              soon as we do this, all direct children of that element become
              grid items.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this example, I have a containing div with a class of wrapper
              and, inside are five child elements.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>
                &lt;div class="wrapper"><br />
                &lt;div>One&lt;/div> <br />
                &lt;div>Two&lt;/div> <br />
                &lt;div>Three&lt;/div> <br />
                &lt;div>Four&lt;/div> <br />
                &lt;div>Five<&lt;/div> <br />
                &lt;/div>
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>I make the .wrapper a grid container.</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code> .wrapper { display: grid; } </code>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>All the direct children are now grid items</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Grid_tracks">
            <header><h1>Grid tracks</h1></header>
            <p>
              We define rows and columns on our grid with the
              grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties. These
              define grid tracks. A grid track is the space between any two
              lines on the grid.
            </p>
            <h3>Basic example</h3>
            <p>
              I can add to our earlier example by adding the
              grid-template-columns property, then defining the size of the
              column tracks.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have now created a grid with three 200-pixel-wide column tracks.
              The child items will be laid out on this grid one in each grid
              cell.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>
                &lt;div class="wrapper"><br />
                &lt;div>One&lt;/div><br />
                &lt;div>Two&lt;/div><br />

            <header><h1>Grid lines</h1></header>
            <p>
              It should be noted that when we define a grid we define the grid
              tracks, not the lines. Grid then gives us numbered lines to use
              when positioning items. In our three column, two row grid we have
              four column lines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lines are numbered according to the writing mode of the document.
              In a left-to-right language, line 1 is on the left-hand side of
              the grid. In a right-to-left language, it is on the right-hand
              side of the grid. Lines can also be named, and we will look at how
              to do this in a later guide in this series.
            </p>
            <h3>Positioning items against lines</h3>
            <p>
              We will be exploring line based placement in full detail in a
              later article. The following example demonstrates doing this in a
              simple way. When placing an item, we target the line – rather than
              the track.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the following example I am placing the first two items on our
              three column track grid, using the grid-column-start,
              grid-column-end, grid-row-start and grid-row-end properties.
              Working from left to right, the first item is placed against
              column line 1, and spans to column line 4, which in our case is
              the far-right line on the grid. It begins at row line 1 and ends
              at row line 3, therefore spanning two row tracks.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second item starts on grid column line 1, and spans one track.
              This is the default so I do not need to specify the end line. It
              also spans two row tracks from row line 3 to row line 5. The other
              items will place themselves into empty spaces on the grid.
            </p>

              Gutters or alleys between grid cells can be created using the

              Any space used by gaps will be accounted for before space is
              assigned to the flexible length fr tracks, and gaps act for sizing
              purposes like a regular grid track, however you cannot place
              anything into a gap. In terms of line-based positioning, the gap
              acts like a thick line.

              A grid item can become a grid container. In the following example,
              I have the three-column grid that I created earlier, with our two
              positioned items. In this case the first item has some sub-items.
              As these items are not direct children of the grid they do not
              participate in grid layout and so display in a normal document
              flow.
            </p>
            <h3>Nesting without subgrid</h3>
            <p>
              If I set box1 to display: grid I can give it a track definition
              and it too will become a grid. The items then lay out on this new
              grid.

              In this case the nested grid has no relationship to the parent. As
              you can see in the example it has not inherited the gap of the
              parent and the lines in the nested grid do not align to the lines
              in the parent grid.
