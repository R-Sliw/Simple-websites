              <h2>Options</h2>
              <h3>Tetrahedron</h3>
              <p>
                Each face has three numbers, arranged such that the upright
                number, placed either near the vertex or near the opposite edge,
                is the same on all three visible faces. The upright numbers
                represent the value of the roll. This die does not roll well and
                thus it is usually thrown into the air instead.
              </p>
              <h3>Cube</h3>
              <p>
                A common die. The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is 7.
              </p>
              <h3>Octahedron</h3>
              <p>
                Each face is triangular and the die resembles two square
                pyramids attached base-to-base. Usually, the sum of the opposite
                faces is 9.
              </p>
              <h3>Pentagonal trapezohedron</h3>
              <p>
                Each face is a kite. The die has two sharp corners, where five
                kites meet, and ten blunter corners, where three kites meet. The
                ten faces usually bear numbers from zero to nine, rather than
                one to ten (zero being read as "ten" in many applications).
                Often all odd numbered faces converge at one sharp corner, and
                the even ones at the other. The sum of the numbers on opposite
                faces is usually 9 (if numbered 0–9) or 11 (if numbered 1–10).
              </p>
              <h3>Dodecahedron</h3>
              <p>
                Each face is a regular pentagon. The sum of the numbers on
                opposite faces is usually 13.
              </p>
              <h3>Icosahedron</h3>
              <p>
                Faces are equilateral triangles. Icosahedra have been found
                dating to Roman/Ptolemaic times, but it is not known if they
                were used as gaming dice. Modern dice with 20 sides are
                sometimes numbered 0–9 twice as an alternative to 10-sided dice.
                The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is 21 if numbered 1–20.
